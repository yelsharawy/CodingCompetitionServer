    Before I can create the program to run a game between two player programs, I have to have a game.
    So I started creating the game Tic-Tac-Toe

    Finished tic-tac-toe game, with both a manual player (for debugging) and a random player (in Python).

    Created a program that can start the tic-tac-toe game and two players.
    I also figured out how Linux namespaces work, so that I can use them for greater security.

    Worked on the reranker & implemented ELO rating system, a bit behind schedule thanks to college stuff
